# Leukemia Subtype Data Exploration

## Overview
This project aims to explore the Golub Gene Expression Dataset. We will explore various EDA techniques to identify significant genes, reduce dimensionality, and derive insights. The project integrates bioinformatics with data science to improve understanding and diagnosis of leukemia.

## Dataset
The Golub Gene Expression Dataset consists of:
- **Samples**: 72 patients (47 ALL, 25 AML)
- **Features**: Over 7,000 gene expression measurements
- 
## Tools & Technologies
- **R** (for analysis and visualization)
- **tidyverse**, **dplyr**, **ggplot2** (for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization)
